A Chief General Manager (CGM) is a top-level executive who manages major divisions, zones, or critical functions of the bank.
Think of hierarchy like this:
Clerk → Officer → Manager → Senior Manager → CM → AGM → DGM → GM → CGM → Executive Director → MD/CEO
So CGM sits just below the top executive level.

A Chief Manager(CM) is a senior middle-management officer in the bank.
They are above Manager and Senior Manager, but below AGM/DGM/GM levels.
Simple hierarchy (officer side)
Officer (Scale I)
Manager (Scale II)
Senior Manager (Scale III)
Chief Manager (Scale IV) ← this level
